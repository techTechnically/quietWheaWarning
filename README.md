# quietWheaWarning
This script for Windows will help alert you to WHEA errors that occur on your system while signed in. It is to be used in conjunction with a scheduled task that is triggered when an WHEA Error log is added to the Event Viewer. The location of these errors for Windows 7 and later in the Event Viewer is: "Application and Service Logs / Microsoft / Windows / Kernel-WHEA / Errors". You may also find WHEA logs mixed in the "System" log for most modern versions of Windows. 

For detailed instructions on how to implement this script, please see the following YouTube videos:
